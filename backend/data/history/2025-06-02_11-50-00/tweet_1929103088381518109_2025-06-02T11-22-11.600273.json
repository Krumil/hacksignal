    "text": "We’ve talked about scaling Ethereum. We’ve talked about L2s. But now, we’re moving from talk… to trustless execution.\n\n@arbitrum isn’t just “on Ethereum.” It’s about to become inseparable from it in the best possible way.\n\nWe’re entering a new era where Arbitrum and #Ethereum will communicate natively, without middlemen, without wrapped assets, and without the usual risks of cross-chain movement.\n\nThat means faster transactions. Safer bridging. Simpler user flows. Better #dApp experiences. And above all, fewer hoops to jump through just to move value.\n\nHere’s what this unlocks: \n✅ Seamless cross-chain apps\n✅ True L2 composability\n✅ Native asset transfers\n✅ Reduced dependency on centralized bridges\n✅ Better UX for everyone\n\nIt’s the dream of L2s finally coming to life.\n\nEthereum becomes the secure base. Arbitrum handles the speed. Together, they create a fluid, unified #ecosystem that feels like one chain.\n\nThe walls between L1 and L2 are coming down, and what’s being built is a faster, safer, and more scalable #Web3.\n\nWe’re not just scaling Ethereum anymore.\n\nWe’re syncing with it.\nAnd the possibilities is Limitless.\n\n#Arbitrum #Ethereum #Interoperability #Web3 #L2Future #OnchainInnovation",
