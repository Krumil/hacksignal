# Hackathon Monitor - Governance Policy

This document outlines the data handling, privacy, and compliance policies for the Hackathon Monitor system.

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Retention Policy

### Storage Duration

-   **Raw tweet data**: Maximum 30 days retention (configurable via `config.json`)
-   **Enriched event data**: Maximum 30 days retention
-   **User feedback data**: Retained until user requests deletion or system replacement
-   **Configuration data**: Retained for system operation

### Automated Cleanup

-   Raw tweet files older than retention period are automatically deleted
-   Enriched event data is purged on the same schedule
-   System logs are rotated and purged according to retention policy

### Manual Data Management

Users can:

-   Request immediate deletion of specific data
-   Export their feedback data in CSV format
-   Modify retention periods via configuration (minimum 7 days, maximum 90 days)

## üîí Privacy Stance

### Data Collection Scope

**What we collect:**

-   Public tweet content from configured hashtags and accounts
-   Public user profile information (follower counts, usernames)
-   User feedback on alert relevance (voluntary)

**What we DO NOT collect:**

-   Private messages or protected tweets
-   Personal information beyond public profile data
-   User location data or tracking information
-   Any data from non-consenting users

### Data Usage

-   **Primary purpose**: Identify relevant hackathon opportunities for indie developers
-   **Secondary purpose**: Improve threshold algorithms through voluntary feedback
-   **No commercial data sharing**: Data is not sold or shared with third parties
-   **No profiling**: Individual user behavior is not tracked or analyzed

### User Rights

-   **Transparency**: Full visibility into what data is collected and why
-   **Control**: Users can opt out of feedback collection at any time
-   **Deletion**: Users can request deletion of their feedback data
-   **Portability**: Feedback data can be exported in machine-readable format

## üèõÔ∏è Platform Developer Policy Compliance

### X (Twitter) API Usage

**Rate Limiting:**

-   Strict adherence to X API rate limits
-   Exponential backoff implemented for all API calls
-   Maximum retry attempts capped at 3 per request
-   Rate limit window respected (15-minute windows)

**Content Guidelines:**

-   Only access publicly available content
-   No attempts to circumvent platform restrictions
-   Respect user privacy settings (protected accounts ignored)
-   No automated engagement (likes, retweets, replies)

**Authentication:**

-   Secure credential storage via environment variables
-   No hardcoded API keys or tokens
-   Regular credential rotation recommended
-   Bearer token authentication for read-only access

### Ethical Usage Standards

**Responsible Monitoring:**

-   Monitor only relevant hashtags and accounts
-   Avoid excessive polling that could impact platform performance
-   Focus on genuine hackathon announcements, not general content
-   Respect intellectual property and attribution

**No Manipulation:**

-   No attempts to influence trending topics or engagement
-   No artificial amplification of content
-   No automated responses or interactions
-   Read-only monitoring approach

## üìä Rate Limiting Guidelines

### API Call Management

**Current Limits (configurable):**

-   Tweet search: 300 calls per 15-minute window
-   User lookup: 300 calls per 15-minute window
-   Account following: Minimal usage for account monitoring

**Backoff Strategy:**

-   First retry: 2-second delay
-   Second retry: 4-second delay
-   Third retry: 8-second delay
-   After 3 failures: Wait for next rate limit window

**Monitoring:**

-   Track API usage against limits
-   Alert when approaching 80% of rate limits
-   Graceful degradation when limits exceeded

## üîê Security & Access

### Data Security

-   **Local storage only**: No cloud storage of collected data
-   **File permissions**: Restricted access to data directories
-   **No network exposure**: Data not accessible via network interfaces
-   **Encryption**: Sensitive configuration encrypted at rest

### Access Control

-   **Single-user system**: Designed for individual developer use
-   **No remote access**: No built-in remote management capabilities
-   **Audit logging**: All data access logged with timestamps
-   **Credential isolation**: API credentials separate from application code

## üìã Compliance Checklist

### Before Deployment

-   [ ] X API credentials properly configured
-   [ ] Rate limiting parameters set appropriately
-   [ ] Data retention period configured (‚â§ 90 days)
-   [ ] Feedback system properly informed consent
-   [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code

### Ongoing Compliance

-   [ ] Regular monitoring of API usage vs. limits
-   [ ] Periodic review of data retention (monthly)
-   [ ] User feedback system functioning correctly
-   [ ] No unauthorized data collection detected
-   [ ] Platform terms of service changes reviewed

### Incident Response

-   [ ] Data breach notification procedure defined
-   [ ] API access revocation procedure ready
-   [ ] User data deletion procedure documented
-   [ ] Platform compliance violation response plan

## üîÑ Feedback Data Usage

### Collection Method

-   **Voluntary only**: Users choose to provide feedback
-   **Categorized responses**: Predefined categories (useful, too_big, low_prize, irrelevant)
-   **Optional comments**: Free-text feedback is optional
-   **Anonymous option**: No requirement to identify feedback source

### Usage for Improvement

-   **Threshold optimization**: Improve relevance and ROI thresholds
-   **Algorithm tuning**: Enhance keyword detection and scoring
-   **Quality metrics**: Calculate precision and recall statistics
-   **System validation**: Verify alert accuracy and usefulness

### Storage and Access

-   **Local CSV file**: Stored in `data/feedback/feedback.csv`
-   **No external transmission**: Feedback never leaves local system
-   **User control**: Users can edit or delete their feedback entries
-   **Retention**: Subject to same 30-day retention policy unless user specifies otherwise

## üìû Contact and Governance

### Policy Updates

-   This policy may be updated to reflect changes in platform requirements
-   Users will be notified of material changes via system alerts
-   Previous versions maintained for reference
-   Community input welcomed for policy improvements

### Questions and Concerns

-   **Technical issues**: Submit via project GitHub issues
-   **Privacy concerns**: Contact project maintainers directly
